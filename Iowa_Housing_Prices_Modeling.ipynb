    "## Iowa Housing Prices Modeling\n",
    "George Armentrout\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, information regarding approximately 2000 real estate listings in Iowa will be utilized in modeling the sale price of houses in the region.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several different models will be employed. Although they are all linear regressions, each approach will have slight variation in their regularization method. Specifically, all regressions will utilize the mean square error loss function, however one model will have no regularization, one model wil use Ridge Regression with $\\lambda = 0.10,0.30,0.60,$, and one model will use Lasso Regression with $\\lambda = 0.02,0.06,0.10$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is comprised of several components, listed as followed:\n",
    "1. Investigate the provided data and features and decide which features to use in the regression.\n",
    "2. Clean the data to contain only the features to be utilized and the associated sale price.\n",
    "3. Divide the given dataset into the necessary subsets (training, validation, and test sets).\n",
    "4. Utilizing the package Scikit-Learn, implement the specified models.\n",
    "5. Train the models using the training set.\n",
    "6. Utilize the validation set to select the best model.\n",
    "7. Evaluate the model's performance with the test data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Determining Features for Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "In the dataset provided, there are 79 features listed with each real estate listing in addition to the sale price of the listing itself. Generally, including more features can allow for a more precise and accurate model. However, allowing for too may features may not be in the best interest of the model. This can be due to overfitting, where a model follows a dataset too closely and only accurately models the training dataset rather than the phenomena itself. Additionally, increasing the number of features demands more computational power, lowering the efficiency of the regression and worsening the performance of the model itself. For this project, 47 features are being considered as followed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lot area (square feet)\n",
    "- Overall quality (scale: 1 to 10)\n",
    "- Overall condition (scale: 1 to 10)\n",
    "- Year built\n",
    "- Year remodeled (= year built if no remodeling or additions)\n",
    "- Finished basement (square feet)\n",
    "- Unfinished basement (square feet)\n",
    "- Total basement (square feet)\n",
    "- First floor (square feet)\n",
    "- Second floor (square feet)\n",
    "- Living area (square feet)\n",
    "- Number of full bathrooms\n",
    "- Number of half bathrooms\n",
    "- Number of bedrooms\n",
    "- Total rooms above grade\n",
    "- Number of fireplaces\n",
    "- Parking spaces in garage\n",
    "- Garage area (square feet)\n",
    "- Wood deck (square feet)\n",
    "- Open porch (square feet)\n",
    "- Enclosed porch (square feet)\n",
    "- Neighborhood (25 features)*\n",
    "- Basement quality**\n",
    "\n",
    "\\* There are 25 unique neighborhoods in the dataset. Each neighborhood is implemented as a binary feature (1 if the listing is in the specified neighborhood, 0 if not).\n",
    "\n",
    "\\*\\* Basement quality is a qualitative metric that is categorized as either 'Excellent,' 'Good,' 'Typical,' 'Fair,' 'Poor,' or 'No basement.' For this regression, this metric is assigned a value of 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, or 0, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Cleaning the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "With the above determination of features to be utilized in the regression, there is a large amount of superfluous data present in the dataset. Additionally, several of these datapoints need to be derived from information provided in the dataset. In cleaning this dataset, first ensure that all features needed for the regression are calculated and present. These can be in either pre-existing columns or new columns of the dataframe.\n",
    "\n",

    "- Overall quality (scale: 1 to 10): \"OverallQual\"\n",
    "- Overall condition (scale: 1 to 10): \"OverallCond\"\n",

    "Please note, typically any bedrooms or bathrooms built below grade (in the basement) are not included in the count of bedrooms and bathrooms in appraisal, and therefore are not included in the number of full/half bathrooms or bedrooms. Similarly, no finished basement square footage is included in the living area feature."
